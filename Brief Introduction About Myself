Youssef is an ambitious Egyptian electrical engineering student whose journey began at the Advanced Technical School for Nuclear Energy in El Dabaa—
a selective boarding school designed to cultivate future leaders in nuclear and electrical engineering. Deeply passionate about physics, engineering, and innovation,
he has built a solid foundation in both theory and practice, working on projects ranging from a miniature steam power plant to an electromagnetic launcher.
Beyond his technical curiosity, Youssef’s mindset blends science with philosophy and humanism; he believes that engineering divorced from the humanities loses its soul.
